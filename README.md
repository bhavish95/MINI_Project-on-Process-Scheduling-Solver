# MINI_Project-on-Process-Scheduling-Solver
The purpose of this project is to outline impmentationofProcess Scheduling Solver through a GUI application with the help of javax.swing, java.awt, java.util packagesand java collections frameworks. The project is all about to demonstrate the working of algorithms like FCFS(First Come First Serve), SJF(Shortest Job First), SRTF(Shortest Remaining Time First) with different processes  having  different arrival  timesand  different burst  times.  The  user  is  being  provided with choices of different algorithms to solve the process scheduling and in order, to provide their working  operations  GUI  interface  has  been  provided.  The  record  for  the process  ids, arrival times, bursttimes, completion time, turnaround times, waiting timesalong with  the average Turn AroundTimeand average Waiting Timehas been provided for the details.
